# Libraries & Technical Decisions
### Angular:
Chosen for its robust architecture, modularity, and strong CLI support.
### Tailwind CSS:
Selected for rapid, utility-first styling and easy responsiveness.
### HammerJS: 
(Optional) For intuitive swipe gestures in the Tinder-like UI.
### RxJS & HttpClient: 
Used for reactive programming and handling asynchronous API calls.
### jQuery UI: 
Integrated for legacy UI elements; custom CSS overrides its styles as needed.
### Project Structure: 
Divided into Core (services, models), Components (pages like List, Detail & Like), and Shared components to keep code organized and maintainable.
